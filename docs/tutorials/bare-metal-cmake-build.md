# Bare-Metal CMake Build

This tutorial walks you through a complete bare-metal DAQIRI build on a Linux host — from verifying the kernel, driver, NIC, and CUDA prerequisites, through building a patched DPDK from source, configuring DAQIRI with CMake, installing the library, and recovering from the most common failure modes.

It is the long-form companion to the five-line `cmake` snippet in [Getting Started](../getting-started.md#build-the-daqiri-library).

!!! tip "Prefer the container build"

    The [container build](../getting-started.md#build-the-daqiri-library) ships a dmabuf-patched DPDK and all user-space dependencies pre-installed. It is the recommended path for almost everyone. Use this bare-metal tutorial when:

    - your host distribution or CUDA stack is fixed and you cannot run a container;
    - you are packaging DAQIRI into another product that already provides a runtime image;
    - you are debugging a build problem inside the container's `daqiri-build` stage and need to reproduce it on the host.

    If none of those apply, follow [System Configuration](system_configuration.md) and then [Benchmarking Examples](benchmarking_examples.md) instead.

## Prerequisite verification

Before installing anything, run the checks below and resolve any failures. They all run as a regular user.

| Check | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA driver + GPU | `nvidia-smi` | Driver version printed; one or more GPUs listed |
| CUDA Toolkit (11.7+) | `nvcc --version` | `Cuda compilation tools, release 11.7` or later |
| NIC kernel drivers | `lsmod \| grep ib_core` | `ib_core` listed |
| NIC user-space tools | `ibv_devinfo` | At least one `mlx5_*` HCA in `PORT_ACTIVE` state |
| ConnectX device on PCIe | `lspci -d 15b3:` | One or more Mellanox/NVIDIA networking entries |
| Kernel dma-buf support | `zgrep CONFIG_DMA_SHARED_BUFFER /proc/config.gz` | `=y` (built-in) |

??? failure "`nvidia-smi: command not found`"

    Install the NVIDIA driver. On Ubuntu the simplest path is `sudo ubuntu-drivers install`. The driver must be a recent branch with GPUDirect support — see the [system requirements table](../getting-started.md#system-requirements).

??? failure "`nvcc: command not found` (but `nvidia-smi` works)"

    The runtime driver is installed but the CUDA Toolkit is not. Add the CUDA APT repository for your distribution from [NVIDIA's CUDA downloads page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux) and `sudo apt install cuda-toolkit`. Then ensure `nvcc` is on `PATH` (typically `/usr/local/cuda/bin`).

??? failure "`lsmod | grep ib_core` is empty"

    The NIC kernel drivers are not loaded. Follow [Check your NIC drivers](system_configuration.md#check-your-nic-drivers) in System Configuration to install `doca-ofed` (or the inbox `rdma-core` stack) and reboot.

??? failure "`/proc/config.gz` does not exist"

    Some kernels don't expose `/proc/config.gz`. Try `cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_DMA_SHARED_BUFFER` instead. The expected value is `=y`. Without dma-buf support the patched DPDK built in [Step 3](#step-3-build-dpdk-with-daqiri-patches) cannot register GPU memory regions and DAQIRI will fall back to the legacy peermem path.

## Step 1: Configure the DOCA APT repository

DAQIRI's RDMA/ibverbs dependencies (`libibverbs-dev`, `librdmacm-dev`, `libmlx5-1`, `mlnx-ofed-kernel-utils`, `mft`) come from the DOCA repository. The exact apt setup commands for IGX OS 1.1, SBSA Ubuntu 22.04, and x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 are in [Getting Started → Build the DAQIRI library](../getting-started.md#build-the-daqiri-library) — run the tab that matches your platform, then return here.

!!! note

    The container build uses DOCA `3.2.1` (see `DOCA_VERSION` in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/Dockerfile)). Earlier DOCA releases also work; the version pinning is for build reproducibility, not a strict requirement.

## Step 2: Install build tooling and RDMA libraries

The package list below mirrors the `base`, `base-deps`, and `dpdk` stages of the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/Dockerfile) and is the minimum needed for the recipe that follows.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    git \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    pkg-config \
    ninja-build \
    meson \
    python3-pyelftools \
    libnuma-dev \
    libibverbs-dev \
    librdmacm-dev \
    libmlx5-1 \
    ibverbs-utils \
    mlnx-ofed-kernel-utils \
    mft
```

DAQIRI's top-level CMake requires version 3.20 or newer (see [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)). On Ubuntu 22.04 the distribution package is too old; install a current build from the Kitware APT repository:

```bash
OS_CODENAME=$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
curl -fsSL https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc \
    | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ ${OS_CODENAME} main" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kitware.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends kitware-archive-keyring cmake cmake-data
cmake --version   # expect >= 3.20
```

??? note "Optional: Python bindings"

    Skip this if you do not need `import daqiri` from Python. To build the pybind11 bindings later with `-DDAQIRI_BUILD_PYTHON=ON`:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends python3-dev pybind11-dev
    ```

??? note "Optional: GDS (cuFile) for device-memory file writes"

    Skip this unless you plan to enable `-DDAQIRI_ENABLE_GDS=ON`. The cuFile headers and `libcufile` are installed as part of the CUDA Toolkit (`cuda-toolkit-*` metapackage) and need no separate apt step. The runtime requirements (`nvidia-fs` kernel module, supported destination filesystem) are documented in [Getting Started](../getting-started.md#cmake-options).

## Step 3: Build DPDK with DAQIRI patches

DAQIRI requires DPDK with the two patches in [`dpdk_patches/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/dpdk_patches): `dmabuf.patch` enables GPUDirect through the kernel dma-buf interface (so `nvidia-peermem` is **not** required), and `dpdk.nvidia.patch` adds the NVIDIA-specific changes consumed by the DPDK backend. The recipe below is the literal sequence run by the `dpdk` stage of the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/Dockerfile).

### 3.1 Clone DAQIRI

You need the repository for `dpdk_patches/` regardless of whether you also build DAQIRI from this clone in [Step 4](#step-4-configure-daqiri-with-cmake).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri.git
cd daqiri
```

### 3.2 Download and patch DPDK 25.11

```bash
DPDK_VERSION=25.11
curl -fsSL https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-${DPDK_VERSION}.tar.xz -o /tmp/dpdk-${DPDK_VERSION}.tar.xz
tar xf /tmp/dpdk-${DPDK_VERSION}.tar.xz -C /tmp
cd /tmp/dpdk-${DPDK_VERSION}

# dmabuf.patch carries .mailmap and release-notes hunks that conflict on a
# stock tarball; exclude them. dpdk.nvidia.patch applies cleanly.
git apply \
    --exclude=.mailmap \
    --exclude=doc/guides/rel_notes/release_26_03.rst \
    "$OLDPWD/dpdk_patches/dmabuf.patch"
git apply "$OLDPWD/dpdk_patches/dpdk.nvidia.patch"
```

### 3.3 Configure, build, and install

The `meson setup` flags below match the container build. The `disable_drivers` list trims drivers DAQIRI never uses, cutting build time and the installed footprint.

```bash
DPDK_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/dpdk-build
DPDK_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

meson setup ${DPDK_BUILD_DIR} \
    --prefix=${DPDK_INSTALL_PREFIX} \
    -Dtests=false \
    -Dplatform=generic \
    -Denable_docs=false \
    -Ddisable_drivers=baseband/*,bus/ifpga/*,common/cpt,common/dpaax,common/iavf,common/octeontx,common/octeontx2,crypto/nitrox,net/ark,net/atlantic,net/avp,net/axgbe,net/bnx2x,net/bnxt,net/cxgbe,net/e1000,net/ena,net/enic,net/fm10k,net/hinic,net/hns3,net/i40e,net/ixgbe,vdpa/ifc,net/igc,net/liquidio,net/mana,net/netvsc,net/nfp,net/qede,net/sfc,net/thunderx,net/vdev_netvsc,net/vmxnet3,regex/octeontx2

cd ${DPDK_BUILD_DIR}
ninja
sudo meson install
sudo ldconfig
```

### 3.4 Verify

```bash
pkg-config --modversion libdpdk   # expect 25.11.x
pkg-config --libs libdpdk         # should print -lrte_eal -lrte_mbuf ... etc.
```

If `pkg-config` cannot find `libdpdk`, add the install location to its search path:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:-}
```

(Replace `x86_64-linux-gnu` with `aarch64-linux-gnu` on ARM hosts.)

## Step 4: Configure DAQIRI with CMake

From the `daqiri` repository root (the clone you made in [Step 3.1](#31-clone-daqiri)):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
    -DDAQIRI_MGR="dpdk socket rdma" \
    -DDAQIRI_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
    -DDAQIRI_BUILD_PYTHON=OFF
```

The sections below explain each option you might want to flip from the default, with an explicit "when to use" guidance. The full reference is the [CMake Options table](../getting-started.md#cmake-options).

### `DAQIRI_MGR` — backend selection

`DAQIRI_MGR` is a space-separated list controlling which backends are compiled into `libdaqiri.so`. Three recipes cover almost all use cases:

| Recipe | What you get | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `-DDAQIRI_MGR="dpdk"` | DPDK raw Ethernet only | DPDK-only deployments; smallest build |
| `-DDAQIRI_MGR="dpdk socket"` | DPDK + kernel UDP/TCP (and RoCE-over-RDMA — see note) | Adds a no-NIC comparison baseline |
| `-DDAQIRI_MGR="dpdk socket rdma"` | DPDK + sockets + ibverbs RDMA | Recommended default; matches the container |

!!! note "`socket` implicitly pulls in `rdma`"

    The socket backend reuses the RoCE transport from the RDMA implementation, so requesting `socket` also builds `rdma`. The logic lives in [`src/CMakeLists.txt:183-193`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/src/CMakeLists.txt). The reverse is not true — listing `rdma` alone does **not** pull in `socket`.

### `DAQIRI_BUILD_PYTHON` — pybind11 bindings

`-DDAQIRI_BUILD_PYTHON=ON` builds the `daqiri` Python module from `python/`. It requires the `python3-dev` and `pybind11-dev` packages from the optional step in [Step 2](#step-2-install-build-tooling-and-rdma-libraries). Leave it `OFF` (the default) if you only consume DAQIRI from C++.

### `DAQIRI_ENABLE_GDS` — cuFile burst writes

`-DDAQIRI_ENABLE_GDS=ON` enables the `cuFile`-backed file-write path for bursts whose payload lives in CUDA device memory. The build requires `cufile.h` and `libcufile` (both shipped with the CUDA Toolkit). At runtime you also need the `nvidia-fs` kernel module loaded and a GDS-supported destination filesystem; verify with the snippet in [Getting Started](../getting-started.md#cmake-options). Without this flag, device-memory burst writes return `NOT_SUPPORTED`; host-memory writes are unaffected.

### `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` — GPU compute capability

The CUDA architectures DAQIRI compiles for are currently hardcoded to `80;90;121` (A100, H100, GB10) at [`src/CMakeLists.txt:25`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/src/CMakeLists.txt). If your GPU is a different generation, or your installed CUDA Toolkit does not understand one of those architectures (most commonly `121` on older toolkits), override it on the CMake command line:

```bash
# Example: only build for Ada (sm_89, e.g. RTX 6000 Ada)
cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89

# Example: A100 + Ada + Hopper, skip GB10
cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="80;89;90"
```

The override works because `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` is a standard CMake variable; the `set()` in `src/CMakeLists.txt` runs after the command-line cache value is established. Common values:

| GPU family | Architecture |
|---|---|
| A100 | `80` |
| RTX 30xx, A40 | `86` |
| RTX 40xx, RTX 6000 Ada, L40 | `89` |
| H100, H200 | `90` |
| GB10 (DGX Spark) | `121` |
| Blackwell datacenter | `100` |

### Other flags

- `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` — produces `libdaqiri.so` (recommended). With `OFF`, you get a static library.
- `-DDAQIRI_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` — builds the `daqiri_bench_*` executables under `build/examples/`. Required for the smoke test in [Step 5.3](#53-smoke-test). On by default.
- `-DDAQIRI_REORDER_GPU_PROFILE=ON` — instruments the CUDA reorder kernels with CUDA event timing. Off by default; turn on only when profiling.

## Step 5: Build, install, and verify

### 5.1 Build

```bash
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
```

A clean build on a modern workstation takes a few minutes; the slowest single translation unit is `src/kernels.cu`.

### 5.2 Install

Install to a prefix of your choice. `/opt/daqiri` matches both the container and the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) recipe:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build --prefix /opt/daqiri
```

Confirm the expected artifacts are in place:

```bash
ls /opt/daqiri/include/daqiri/daqiri.h
ls /opt/daqiri/lib/libdaqiri.so
ls /opt/daqiri/lib/cmake/daqiri/
ls /opt/daqiri/lib/pkgconfig/daqiri.pc
ldd /opt/daqiri/lib/libdaqiri.so | head
```

`ldd` should show `librte_*` (DPDK), `libibverbs.so`, `librdmacm.so`, `libcudart.so`, and `libyaml-cpp.so` resolving. Unresolved entries usually mean either DPDK was installed to a prefix not on the dynamic loader path (add it to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` and re-run `sudo ldconfig`), or the RDMA libraries from [Step 2](#step-2-install-build-tooling-and-rdma-libraries) were not actually installed.

### 5.3 Smoke test

The fastest verification needs no physical link and no special hardware — the `sw_loopback` config runs an in-process TX/RX through DPDK's software loopback:

```bash
sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect \
    ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_sw_loopback.yaml \
    --seconds 5
```

A successful run prints a stream of `[INFO]` lines followed by an RX/TX rate summary. If the program aborts immediately with `EAL: No free hugepages reported`, see [Step 6: Troubleshooting](#step-6-troubleshooting) below.

To run a real two-port loopback over a physical cable, continue with [Benchmarking Examples](benchmarking_examples.md).

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

??? failure "CMake: `Could not find a package configuration file provided by ... libdpdk`"

    `pkg-config` cannot locate the DPDK installation. Either point it at the prefix you used in [Step 3.3](#33-configure-build-and-install):

    ```bash
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
    ```

    or, if you installed DPDK from MLNX_OFED to `/opt/mellanox/dpdk`, rely on the fallback at [`src/CMakeLists.txt:67-69`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/daqiri/blob/main/src/CMakeLists.txt) — no extra environment variable needed, but the path must exist.

??? failure "CMake: `Could not find libibverbs` / `librdmacm`"

    The RDMA development headers are missing. Re-run the apt install from [Step 2](#step-2-install-build-tooling-and-rdma-libraries):

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev libmlx5-1
    ```

    If apt reports the packages are "installed" but the `-dev` symlinks are missing on disk (this happens on some base images such as `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch`), force a reinstall from the DOCA repository configured in [Step 1](#step-1-configure-the-doca-apt-repository):

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --reinstall libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev libmlx5-1
    ```

??? failure "`nvcc fatal: Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_121'`"

    The CUDA Toolkit on this host predates GB10 / Blackwell support. Either upgrade the toolkit, or pin `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to the architectures your toolkit understands:

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="80;90"
    ```

    See the [GPU compute capability table](#cmake_cuda_architectures-gpu-compute-capability) for valid values.

??? failure "Runtime: `EAL: No free hugepages reported`"

    DPDK could not allocate hugepages because none are reserved. Hugepage configuration is part of system setup, not the build — follow [System Configuration → Step 4: Enable Huge pages](system_configuration.md#step-4-enable-huge-pages) to add a persistent reservation, or reserve some temporarily with:

    ```bash
    echo 1024 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
    ```

??? failure "Runtime: `nvidia-fs not loaded` (with `DAQIRI_ENABLE_GDS=ON`)"

    The cuFile path needs the `nvidia-fs` kernel module loaded and a GDS-supported destination filesystem. Verify with:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep nvidia_fs
    /usr/local/cuda/gds/tools/gdscheck.py -p
    ```

    Full setup notes are in [Getting Started → CMake Options](../getting-started.md#cmake-options). If `nvidia-fs` cannot be loaded on this host, drop `-DDAQIRI_ENABLE_GDS=ON` from the CMake configure step — host-memory burst writes do not require it.

??? failure "`pkg-config: command not found`"

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y pkgconf
    ```

??? failure "DPDK `meson setup`: `ERROR: Dependency \"libnuma\" not found`"

    The Dockerfile installs `libnuma-dev` in the same apt batch as the DPDK build tooling. If you skipped it:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y libnuma-dev
    ```

??? failure "Build succeeds but `ibv_devinfo` reports `0 HCAs found`"

    The user-space libraries are installed but the kernel drivers are not — `lsmod | grep mlx5` will be empty. Follow [Check your NIC drivers](system_configuration.md#check-your-nic-drivers) to install `doca-ofed` and reboot.

## Platform-specific notes

The build recipe above is the same on every supported host. The notes below cover the few places where defaults or expectations diverge — open the tab that matches your hardware.

=== "DGX Spark (GB10)"

    - The integrated **ConnectX-7** appears in `ibv_devinfo` as one or two `mlx5_*` HCAs depending on link configuration; no separate driver install beyond the [DOCA repository setup](#step-1-configure-the-doca-apt-repository) is needed.
    - GB10 is **compute capability 12.1** (`sm_121`), which is already part of the hardcoded default `80;90;121` — no `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` override required, assuming a CUDA Toolkit recent enough to understand `sm_121`.
    - DGX Spark uses **NVLink-C2C unified memory** and has no separate GPU BAR1, so data buffers in YAML configs use `kind: host_pinned` rather than `kind: device`. The DGX-Spark-prefilled YAMLs in `examples/*_spark.yaml` already encode this.
    - `nvidia-peermem` is not used; GPUDirect goes through the dma-buf path enabled by the DPDK patches in [Step 3](#step-3-build-dpdk-with-daqiri-patches).
    - For a runnable end-to-end test after the build completes, follow the [DGX Spark profile callout](benchmarking_examples.md#update-the-loopback-configuration) in Benchmarking Examples — the prefilled `daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_spark.yaml` and `daqiri_bench_rdma_tx_rx_spark.yaml` need only an `eth_dst_addr` edit.

=== "IGX Orin + dGPU"

    - The reference dGPU is the **RTX 6000 Ada** (compute capability **8.9**). The hardcoded default `80;90;121` does **not** include `89`, so override:

        ```bash
        cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="89"
        ```

        Use a different value (or extra entries) if you have a different dGPU installed.
    - On IGX Orin, several system settings (BAR1 size, MRRS, NIC link layer) need to be applied **before** DAQIRI will run end-to-end. Follow the [IGX Orin tab in System Configuration](system_configuration.md) for the full sequence; the build itself does not require those changes.
    - GPUDirect can use either the patched DPDK's dma-buf path (recommended) or the legacy `nvidia-peermem` module. The patched DPDK built in [Step 3](#step-3-build-dpdk-with-daqiri-patches) removes the peermem dependency.
    - For ARM64 (`aarch64`) hosts, set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the aarch64 directory:

        ```bash
        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:-}
        ```

=== "x86_64 RTX Pro Server"

    - "RTX Pro Server" covers any `x86_64` workstation or server with a ConnectX-6 Dx (or later) NIC and an RTX Pro / Workstation GPU. Confirm `nvidia-smi` reports a GPUDirect-capable GPU (any RTX Pro / Quadro / Data Center class card; **not** GeForce — see the warning in [Concepts → GPUDirect](../concepts.md#gpudirect)).
    - Set `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to match the installed card. RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell is `100`; RTX 6000 Ada is `89`; RTX A6000 is `86`:

        ```bash
        cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=100
        ```
    - x86_64 hosts use `/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig` for the DPDK `.pc` file — that's the default `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` entry shown in [Step 3.4](#34-verify).
    - All other steps are identical to the generic recipe above.

## Next steps

Once `libdaqiri.so` is installed and the [smoke test](#53-smoke-test) passes:

1. [**System Configuration**](system_configuration.md) — tune the host (hugepages, NIC link layer, GPU BAR1, CPU isolation) for production performance.
2. [**Benchmarking Examples**](benchmarking_examples.md) — run `daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect` over a physical loopback.
3. [**Understanding the Configuration File**](configuration-walkthrough.md) — pick the right starter YAML for your use case from the decision tree.
